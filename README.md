# Synopsis
Heiden is a small boy who lived happily with his single mother in the hustle and bustle of the big city. However, that changed with the sudden passing of his mother. He decided during the funeral of his late mother to move into the household of his distant uncle, who lived pretty far out in the modest province.
Follow Heiden as he tries to find a new life together with a seemingly strange uncle and the peculiar people of the village while coping the loss of his mother.
Will Heiden find the time and patience to piece together the past of his mother and what happened to his unknown father?
